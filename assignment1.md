# Data reporting critique

This will be a critique of [this article](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/lawless/2019/05/16/lawless-one-in-three-alaska-villages-have-no-local-police/) by Kyle Hopkins at Ancorage Daily News.

### Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 
   * What was it?
   * Was it in the headline?

I give this story a 5 in this category. The central insight communicated by the reporter was clear the moment I read the headline, "Lawless: One in three Alaska villages have no local police." The rest of the story served to provide evidence and context for the problem facing Alaskan villages. It did this through the use of interviews with Alaskan residents, news reporting, and (most relevant to us) data.

 
* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization? 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?

There was only one example of data visualization in the story, it was very clear in its presentation of the data. The reporter created a map with every village without a local police force highlighted. The story also linked to the source of the investigation and data [here](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/lawless/2019/05/16/how-we-tallied-alaska-communities-without-local-law-enforcement/) and explained how the reporters were able to compile the data. Thus, I feel that the story gets a 4 in this catagory. The data was clear, visualized well and very transparent, but there could have been visualizations for more data points in the story. For example, the reporter could have used a pie chart to indicate the percentage of police officers with sexual assault, domestic abuse, and other charges.

* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. 
   * Did they provide a source?
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

The article was thorough with its sourcing, citations, and references for data. They even went so far as to write a [seperate article](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/lawless/2019/05/16/how-we-tallied-alaska-communities-without-local-law-enforcement/) detailing the methods used by the data journalists to compile some of the most relevant data to the story. Most of the data was uncovered by the journalists who worked on the story, so many of the sources were well documented; however, the article references the statistic that "92% of this community have high-powered rifles," a quote from a police cheif to which they provide no more context or citation. This peice of data may in reality be accurate, but the reader has no way of verifying this other than to accept the word of a police cheif. This is the weakest presentation of data throughout the story, and otherwise the data journalists did a fantastic job, warranting a ranking of 4 or 5.

### Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.
 
This story was researched, written, and edited all at a very high caliber. It did a fantastic job in its storytelling by intertwining interviews and storytelling with hard-hitting data points. I found that the sections of the story following Annie Reed helped give a human face to the otherwise lifeless data points and statistics. The anecdotes also helped communicate the severity of the issue, not only do many Alaskan villages not have a police force, but the consequences of this can be disastrous. The only possible negative to this could have been a slight detraction from the data, not allowing the data to speak for itself. However, this is likley a matter of personal preference. In regards to the data iteslf, due to the story being written in partnership with ProPublica, it was investigated and reported on fantastically well. As previously mentioned, an entirely seperate article was written detailing the proccess that the reporters went through in order to uncover and compile the data. The only slight issue with the data as previously mentioned is a moment where they use a quote as an objective statistic without providing any further citation (this may actually be correct and a non-issue, it just struck me as odd when reading). Because of the aforementioned, I belive that this story warrants a 5 as its rating for quality overall.


### Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together?
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)
   * Explain
* Color (1-5)
   * Explain

Because there was only one visual, there was very little opportunity for the data journalists to use color and type to communicate the data. However, the map, which highlighted villages without local police presence throughout Alaska was very clear and communicated the data extremely efficiently. The map used red as a highlighting color which helped the sheer quantity of villages without local police presence stand out at a glance. This helped draw the eye to the data which in turn highlighted the central issue being reported on. Due to the small quantity of data visualization, I will very cautiously give the map a 5 for color and type.

   
### Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?
   * How?
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.
 
Again, the story did not include many graphs or other forms of data visualization (only the one map). However, the photos used by the story writers helped communicate the data in a different way. They helped show the humanity of those in the small or nonexistent police forces and the people they serve to protect. This helped emphasize how "One in three Alaska villages have no local police." Throughout the story, photos were used effectively and creatively to communicate the significance of the data, and I again give this story a 5 in this category.
