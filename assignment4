Makeover Monday
#MakeoverMonday is a data visualization group where people experiment with new ways to visualize data. There is an archive on their site of weekly articles with data visualizations that people try to redesign to improve.

For this assignment, you need to redesign two of the visualizations from the Makeover Monday archive. They can be any two you want, but your redesigned visualizations must be two different chart types (e.g. a bar chart and a line chart, a pie chart and a table, etc...). You can use any tool you want to do this, but it may be easiest to work with a pencil and paper, then take a picture of your work. You can also use Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or whatever you're familiar with.

Things to consider (and you will be graded on):

Reducing visual clutter on the chart
Proper chart type selection
Annotating important data points, where appropriate
Writing a clear hed and dek/subhed for the chart, where appropriate
Don't worry about:

Exact sizing/scale of the data (especially if you're using paper/pencil)
Typefaces/fonts
Color -- unless it is critical to understanding your visualization (i.e. a map where darker colors = higher values)
What you'll turn in
For assignment4.md, you'll turn in:

Links to the two original charts you redesigned.
Links to your chart redesign image files (you can upload PNGs or JPEGs to Github and link from your markdown file -- ask Google or use AI for instructions)
For each visualization, a short list of what changes you made from the original and why
