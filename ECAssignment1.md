# Final Project Data Visualization

As a potential component to our final project, I decided to create a sort of heat map for all DC crime since 2021. I used QGIS to map all crimes onto a map of DC. As an added component, I also mapped where all DC police stations are located with the size of the stations' symbols correlating with the number of officers working there. This way the person reading the graph is easily able to asses if officers are being stationed in the correct areas according to the ammount of crime in proximity to each police station.
