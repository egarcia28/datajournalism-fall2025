[## Makeover Monday Graph #1](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2025/06/25/spirituality-and-religion-us-comparison-to-other-countries/#sortable-table)

For this graph, I felt like it had too much information, and it was all presented in a cluttered, number heavy way. 
The biggest change I made to it was focusing only on the data for the US. 
I recognize that this change removes most of the data in the graph, but I felt that the quantity of numbers and raw data needed to be cut down on in some way. 
I assumed that, since most people reading the graph would be from, or at least in America (The Pew Research Center is an American think tank), I could safely focus only on the data for the US.
Because the data was now much more manageable, I was able to convert it to a bar graph so that readers could more easily compare proportions of Americans who identify with each bar.
I kept the percentages included as well in order to offer the specific data to the reader as well.

For this graph, I noticed that the data was representing parts of a whole.
In this case, the parts were the religion and the whole was the population of global migrants.
Because of this, my mind went stright to a pie chart, so I converted the bar graph to a pie chart.
I used color to match each religion to its slice on the chart, and also included the exact percentages for accuracy.
