# Story Critique

For this assignment I critiqued [this](https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2023/bleeding-out/trauma-deserts-bleeding-to-death-united-states/) story from _The Dallas Morning News_.


### Lede: What kind of lede did the reporter use? Do you think it was effective in enaging the reader and communicating what the story would be about? Why or why not?
The reporter used an anecdotal lede about a dramatic rescue for a traumatic injury in Colorado. It very effectively engages the reader due to its graphic, yet incredibly accurate portrayal of traumatic rescues in trauma deserts. The lede also does a good job of setting up what the story will be about, it perfectly illustrates an example of the problerm that the article ends up discussing. Due to the viceral nature of the story, I would argue that an anecdoteal lede is one of the most effective techniques for grabbing the reader's attention.

### The data: What did the analysis involve and what were the findings? Thinking critically about it, are there any problems you see or areas you have more questions about?
The analysts were examining how geographic variables can influence your access to trauma care. The findings included that trauma care in the US is inequitable, meaning that "where you live can determine whether you survive." Most of the analysis was centered around access to Level I and II trauma centers; however; the article dosen't fully explain what kinds of injuries require Level I or II trauma centers, or how common these kinds of injuries are. It does ackowledge this to an extent, but I feel like some of this analysis could be more fleshed out.

### Sources: How did the story integrate human sources to speak to the data? Did they agree or contradict with the reporters' findings from the data? In your opinion, how did they help or hurt the story?
The story used many different sources that were all able to speak to a different aspect of the issue. They used EMT's and trauma doctors to speak to the practical side of the issue, and to explain how medical professionals deal with it. The reporters also spoke to academic researchers who were able to speak to the wider trends that they have uncovered through their research. The reporters also must have spoken to the actual people affected by these trauma deserts as indicated by the anecdotal lede. By combining all of these parts, the reporters create a cohesive picture of what a trauma desert is, how it affects people, and who it affects.

### Story structure: Which of the following techniques did the story use (can be more than one)? For each, describe how it was used. Feel free to include other techniques if you identify them. Hint: If the story uses subheds, those can be helpful to identify structure.
From what I could tell, the story seems to use the inverted pyramid structure where the most important and relevant information is presented first, and as the story progresses, more and more detailed analysis is done. For example, in this story, the first data visualization is a map showing distances from trauma centers accross the country, this is data that is most relevant to the story and showing the geographic trends of these trauma centers. The story then moves into the factors that help analysts illustrate the larger trends, such as the ratio between pre-hospital vs. in-hospital deaths, this is an important part of the story; however, it is more specific than the main idea of "how far are people from trauma centers." The story concludes with incredibly specific logistical challenges and then solutions unique to the problem. These include discussions of how paramedics respond to emergencies, the medical equipment they use to do this, and the budget challenges that first responders and hospitals face. This is also important and relevant, but is again more specific than the main idea.

### Numbers: Was the writing about data clear and engaging? Were there any points that felt bogged down with numbers or could have been written in an easier to understand way? Use examples.
This story did a really good job of limiting the ammount of numbers in the writing itself. This was the most digit-dense sentence I could find, "The trauma mortality rate for rural counties was 93.8 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 71.6 for the state’s other counties." This falls within a comfortable range of digits that is easily digestable for the reader. All of the numbers used feel necessary and irreplaceable. This data lends itself to a less number heavy story and allows more of the data translation to be done through visualization rather than written exaplanation.

### Data viz: How did data visualization add to this story? Were there instances where it felt decorative/unncessary? Why or why not?
The data visualization was the center of the story for me. Because the story is based around geographic factors limiting access to trauma care, maps were the clear choice for data visualizartion in the story. The interactivity of the maps also added to the story, and helped engage the reader by adding a layer of personalization. None of it felt decorative or unnecesarry, because the maps were primarily used to show trends accross the country, they were unable to be replaced with other types of graphs/charts.

### Methods: How did the author address the nuances or limitations of the data? Did they use a nerd box? If so, was it effective? If not, do you think they needed one? Why or why not?
The reporters honestly don't really address the limitations of the data; however, in all fairness to them, there arent many nuances or limitations. The data is simply looking at the geographic patterns of access to trauma centers accross the country. The only possible nuances lie in the collection and methodology of the data which is adressed through this concise "nerd box," "Distance estimates for areas within 30 minutes of a trauma center are generated using Mapbox software. Estimates beyond 30 minutes are generated by calculating the distance from the nearest trauma center to each census block and assuming a speed of 45 miles per hour." This nerd box is more than effective at acknowleging the limitations of the presentation of the data. Although it was short, I still believe that the "nerd box" was necessary, and added information helpful to those curious about the methodology of visualization used by the reporters.

### Etc: Was there anything else in the story that you have further questions about or would have done differently?
As I explained before, I feel that the reporters could have explained the difference between Level I and II trauma centers, and the injuries that require each level to be treated, this could have helped put into perspective the actual situations that are affected by the trauma desterts that the story describes. I would have also liked to see actual quotes from people who have been affected by the trauma deserts, rather than just a singular anecdote. However, I understand that this is likley very hard to implement due to the sensitivity of these issues.
