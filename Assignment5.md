# Story Critique

For this assignment I critiqued [this](https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2023/bleeding-out/trauma-deserts-bleeding-to-death-united-states/) story from _The Dallas Morning News_.


#### Lede: What kind of lede did the reporter use? Do you think it was effective in enaging the reader and communicating what the story would be about? Why or why not?
The reporter used an anecdotal lede about a dramatic rescue for a traumatic injury in Colorado. It very effectively engages the reader due to its graphic, yet incredibly accurate portrayal of traumatic rescues in trauma deserts. The lede also does a good job of setting up what the story will be about, it perfectly illustrates an example of the problerm that the article ends up discussing. Due to the viceral nature of the story, I would argue that an anecdoteal lede is one of the most effective techniques for grabbing the reader's attention.

#### The data: What did the analysis involve and what were the findings? Thinking critically about it, are there any problems you see or areas you have more questions about?


#### Sources: How did the story integrate human sources to speak to the data? Did they agree or contradict with the reporters' findings from the data? In your opinion, how did they help or hurt the story?


#### Story structure: Which of the following techniques did the story use (can be more than one)? For each, describe how it was used. Feel free to include other techniques if you identify them. Hint: If the story uses subheds, those can be helpful to identify structure.

#### Numbers: Was the writing about data clear and engaging? Were there any points that felt bogged down with numbers or could have been written in an easier to understand way? Use examples.


#### Data viz: How did data visualization add to this story? Were there instances where it felt decorative/unncessary? Why or why not?


#### Methods: How did the author address the nuances or limitations of the data? Did they use a nerd box? If so, was it effective? If not, do you think they needed one? Why or why not?


#### Etc: Was there anything else in the story that you have further questions about or would have done differently?
