"The probability of dying from a chronic disease between birth and age 80 dropped in about 150 countries from 2010 to 2019, the study, published Wednesday in The Lancet, found."

"In the United States, the overall probability of dying from a chronic disease fell markedly between 2001 and 2010 but remained nearly flat over the following nine years."

"Among younger adults (20 to 45 years old), this probability increased — a rarity among high-income countries."

"Countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia — including Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Moldova and Russia — saw the greatest declines in the probability of death from chronic disease from 2010 to 2019, whereas some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and South Asia saw slight increases."
